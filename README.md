This directory holds all of the hooks/commands developers can utilize.

These commands are subject to change, however they won't change at random. This directory will serve as insight to our previous API hooks. 

When we update, your agents can update your hooks as well. 

We will try to minimize the amount of changes made. However the dynamics of the project are constantly changing. 

Developers who sign up for an API key will be contacted before any patches roll out so they can create a new branch for their agents to patch their existing API commands.

Utilize the UPDATE.md to have your agents automatically update your configurations.
