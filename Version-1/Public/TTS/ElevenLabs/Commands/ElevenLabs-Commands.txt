ElevenLabs={apiKey}={voiceId} - Sets ElevenLabs API credentials on UE before sending TTS - POST

TTS_ElevenLabs_{text}_{stability}_{similarity}_{style}_{speakerBoost}_{modelFlag}_{emotion}_{intensity} - Sends text to UE for ElevenLabs TTS with MetaHuman lip-sync - POST
Default params: stability=0.5, similarity=0.75, style=0.0, speakerBoost=1.0, modelFlag=1
Emotion defaults to Neutral_0.5 unless emotion analyzer is enabled (uses OpenAI to detect emotion)

Text is sanitized before sending:
- Newlines replaced with spaces
- Underscores replaced with spaces
- Special characters stripped (only word chars, spaces, and basic punctuation kept)

Chunking:
- Long scripts are split into chunks
- Each chunk is sent as a separate TTS command
- Frontend waits for TTS_Complete before sending the next chunk
- Chunks are processed sequentially with 100ms delay between

UE responds with:
TTS_Started - Avatar began speaking - GET
TTS_Complete - Avatar finished speaking (triggers next chunk if queued) - GET
{duration} - Float representing audio duration in seconds (fallback timing) - GET
