No POST commands - timing is entirely UE-driven (push notifications over DataChannel)

TTS_Started - UE notifies frontend that the avatar has begun speaking - GET
TTS_Complete - UE notifies frontend that the avatar has finished speaking - GET
{duration} - Float representing audio duration in seconds (fallback timing mechanism) - GET

Frontend behavior on receive:
- TTS_Started: sets isSpeaking = true, shows LIVE indicator
- TTS_Complete: sets isSpeaking = false, triggers next chunk if in chunk queue mode (100ms delay)
- {duration}: fallback - parses float, waits that many ms, then processes next chunk (only used in chunk mode)

Chunk sequencing:
- TTS_Complete is the primary signal to advance to the next chunk
- Duration-based timing is the fallback if TTS_Complete is not received
- Both mechanisms only fire when isProcessingRef.current is true (chunk mode active)
